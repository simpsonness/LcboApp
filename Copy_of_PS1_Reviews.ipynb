For this exercise, you should have a feature for each word containing at least one alphabetic character. You may use the `numpy` and `sklearn` packages to help with implementing a sparse matrix.\n",

Besides held-out classification accuracy with 10-fold cross-validation, you will also see the features in each class given high weights by the model.\n",
